### Hi, my name is Felipe! ðŸ˜„

I'm from Brazil and currently studying and working with technology. Having as my first degree Civil Engineering at _Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos_, I've decided to expand my knowledge to Computer Science. In February 2020 I enrolled in a _System Development and Analysis_ course, where i'm managing to have excellent performance overall and by August 2021 i've started _working as IT Process Analyst_, automating and reshaping many routines through programming. I'm interested in discovering new technologies and study about them on a daily basis, consistently improving my knowledge!
